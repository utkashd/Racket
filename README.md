# Racket
A small collection of school projects written in Racket, a functional programming language. (For now, I've only found one on my computer)

To run these, download and install the DrRacket application here: https://download.racket-lang.org/ Then, open the desired project using the DrRacket application and click "Run" (green play button, top right corner).

Project 5 starts a local webserver in which one can enter a function (in the form of a Racket-like expression) and the web app will differentiate it for you.

Some sample input/output:

Function:                (* 2 x)
Variable:                x
N:                       1
Point:                   1
Simplify:                off
Nth Symbolic Derivative: (lambda (x) (+ (* 0 x) (* 1 2)))
Nth Numeric Derivative:  2
